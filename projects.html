<h1>Comify</h1>
<p>
Comify takes at least 3 pictures (and up to 9) and turns it into a comic strip.

The app was built originally in ios/swift using AWS image rekognition. Once given the array of objects from AWS, we then selected a protagonist, setting, and adventures from the pictures to create a fantastical adventure for our user.<br /><br /> We then also addded a comic effect to the pictures they uploaded to make it more comic-booky, more likely to go with the story. The natural language processor for story construction uses a corpus of over a million words (1,167,335) to build its n-gram model and predict the next word in a story.  <br /><br/>

<h1>Derm.AI</h1>
<p> Derm.AI allows a user to take a picture of a mole and then compare that picture with our Machine Learning Model to predict if that mole is cancerous. <br /><br />

It originally used an image classification CNN model created on customvision.ai with the ISIC dataset and accuracy of 82%. We have now moved the model to AWS Sagemaker to improve accuracy. It also helps find a nearby dermatologist and oncologist professional and provide their contact information to schedule an appointment, using the Better Doctors API.<br /><br />
