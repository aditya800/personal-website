<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I'm an undergraduate in <a href="http://www.cs.umn.edu">Computer Science</a>, slated to graduate in Dec 2019. My superpower is to come up with eye-popping ideas and use data to assess their possible success. Over the course of my undergraduate career, I have considered this sacrosanct and applied this in making key decisions, be it, selecting classes based on past performance, or just improving my scores in undertaken classes. Besides this, I consider optimism partly important as well.<br /><br /> 

The history of many prominent tech companies is brimmed with occurences of irrational optimism transcending data analytics. For instance, in 1997, when Jeff Bezos showed up to speak at a class at HBS, almost everyone was dismissive of the then nascent Amazon, except one student (former chief video officer of Hulu), who defended the inchoate bookseller by stating the historical importance of its mission, which is why I consider optimism important and believe that just as it was prophesied by Marc Anderson that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">software would consume the world</a>, machine learning too would eat the world someday. Any company that would ebb away from it would eventually bite the dust. <br /><br />

I am looking for internship opportunities in both software development and data science for the summer of 2019. I am an extremely motivated and, process and detail oriented individual. If you think I would be a good match for your team, please email me at saxen065 at umn dot edu for a latest copy of my resume.
